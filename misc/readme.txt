The TMS570LS1224.ccxml can be obtained from the TI uniflash utility or
from the TI code composer studio, somewhere in the project settings.

The testBoard.dat can be obtained from the TI code composer studio.
I.e.: Connect a board and detect / verify the connection with the

project. The path to testBoard.dat is displayed while the connection
is successfully verified.
